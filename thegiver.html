        <p>Ok, before you judge me, I know this does not seem like something I would read based on my past book recs but HEAR ME OUT! It's a great series, it may seem boring at first but its kind of dystopian and that is what gives it that ⭐️jazz.⭐️ Lois Lowry has a way of foreshadowing so subtly you won't even notice until you finish the book and then you're just sitting there thinking WOAHHHHHHHH. So yeah, 8/10, just because I haven't read the fourth book.</p>

        <h3>Book 1</h3>

        <div class="bookdetails"> 
            
            <p>The Giver is the book that leads into this megaverse of dystopian society and it seemed boring at first but I really started to like it when the main character started to gain some depth. The entire bacstory behind this is similar to F451 in a way but its less technologically advanced. You can read all three of these books as standalones but I would recommend reading them in order just so they make sense. 2/4</p>

        </div>
            <h3>Book 2</h3>
        <div class="bookdetails">   
            <p>Gathering Blue did not make any sense at first AT ALL. Jonas is mentioned a bit in this book but when I was reading it I felt SOOO BAD for Kira. She is such a girlboss like I love her so much as a character. She honestly deserves a happy ending. 3/4</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Book 3</h3>
        <div class="bookdetails">   
            <p>The Messenger connects everything from the previous two books in such a perfect way. Kira and Jonas get married in this book I think, or are already married. Honestly I thought Jonas was going to undergo a villian arc but I'm so glad he didn't because then it would just mess up the entire book. MATTY DIES AT THE END THOUGH WHAT THE WORLD. He sacrificed himself for the world, what a man. 1/4</p>
